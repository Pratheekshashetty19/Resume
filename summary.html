    <hr/>
            <p style="justify-content: center;">I am currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science with a specialization in Cybersecurity, and I’m in my third year. I have a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, C#, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I enjoy building practical projects — one of which includes a recipe page web app — that strengthen my skills in both frontend and backend development. I’m passionate about cybersecurity and continuously learning to bridge the gap between secure code and user-friendly design.</p>
